# FootballTeams Smart Contract

## Overview

The `FootballTeams` smart contract allows users to manage football players and assign them to different teams. Each team is represented by a contract address, and players can be added to the system and assigned to these teams. The contract keeps track of player details and their associated teams.

## Features

- **Add Player:** Add new players by specifying their names.
- **Assign Player to Team:** Assign an existing player to a football team, where the team is represented by the contract address of another smart contract.
- **Get Team Player Count:** Retrieve the number of players assigned to a specific team.
- **Get Team Players:** Get the list of player IDs associated with a specific team.
- **Get Player Details:** Retrieve the details of a player by their ID, including the player's name and team address.

## Contract Details

### Data Structures

- **Player Struct:**
  - `name`: The name of the player.
  - `team`: The address of the team (another smart contract) to which the player is assigned.

- **Mappings:**
  - `players`: Maps player IDs to their respective `Player` structs.
  - `teamPlayers`: Maps a team's contract address to a list of player IDs.

### State Variables

- `uint public playerCount`: Keeps track of the total number of players.
- `mapping(uint => Player) public players`: Maps each player ID to their corresponding `Player` struct.
- `mapping(address => uint[]) public teamPlayers`: Maps each team's contract address to a list of player IDs.

### Events

- `PlayerAdded(uint indexed playerId, string name, address indexed team)`: Emitted when a new player is added to the system.
- `PlayerAssigned(uint indexed playerId, address indexed team)`: Emitted when a player is assigned to a team.

### Functions

- **addPlayer(string memory _name):**
  - Adds a new player with the specified name.
  - Increments the `playerCount`.
  - Emits the `PlayerAdded` event.
  - Returns the newly created player's ID.

- **assignPlayerToTeam(uint _playerId, address _team):**
  - Assigns a player (by ID) to a team (by the team's contract address).
  - Updates the player's team in the `players` mapping.
  - Adds the player ID to the `teamPlayers` mapping.
  - Emits the `PlayerAssigned` event.

- **getTeamPlayerCount(address _team):**
  - Returns the number of players assigned to a specific team.

- **getTeamPlayers(address _team):**
  - Returns the list of player IDs associated with a specific team.

- **getPlayer(uint _playerId):**
  - Retrieves the details of a player by their ID, including the player's name and team address.
  - Requires that the player ID is valid.

## How to Use

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Deploy the `FootballTeams` smart contract on your desired Ethereum network.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**
   - Use the contract's functions to add players, assign them to teams, and retrieve player and team information.
